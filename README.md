# AlgoApp Method Unit Test
The [`algoapp_method_unittest`](https://github.com/cusma/algoapp_method_unittest/blob/main/algoapp_method_unittest.py) 
utility library is a support to perform unit tests on Algorand App's methods call, verifying their expected behaviour.

- **Approval Unit Test**: testing a method call expecting App's approval.
- **Rejection Unit Test**: testing a method call expecting App's rejection.

#### Dependencies:
- `py-algorand-sdk` [1.7.0](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
- [`asa_state_observer_asc1`](https://github.com/cusma/asa_state_observer/blob/main/asa_state_observer_asc1.py) to run unit tests example.

## Unit Tests result example
The `algoapp_method_unittest` has been used in this example to perform unit
tests on [ASA State Observer](https://github.com/cusma/asa_state_observer) app methods' behaviour.
